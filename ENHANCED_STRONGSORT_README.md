## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Tracking with Occlusion Handling
```python
from boxmot import StrongSort

# Create enhanced tracker with occlusion handling
tracker = StrongSort(
    reid_weights='osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt',
    device='cpu',
    half=False,
    max_cos_dist=0.15,          # Stricter appearance matching
    max_age=50,                 # Keep tracks longer
    nn_budget=150,              # More ReID memory
    conf_thresh_high=0.7,       # High confidence threshold
    adaptive_matching=True,     # Enable enhancements
    # NEW: Occlusion handling
    handle_occlusions=True,     # Enable occlusion handling
    occlusion_threshold=0.3,    # Overlap detection threshold
    crowd_detection=True,       # Enable crowd mode
)

# Track with enhanced performance and occlusion resistance
tracks = tracker.update(detections, img)

# Get occlusion statistics
stats = tracker.get_track_statistics()
print(f"Occluded tracks: {stats['occluded_tracks']}")
print(f"Crowd mode: {stats['crowd_mode']}")

# Get detailed occlusion report
print(tracker.get_occlusion_report())
```

### Advanced Occlusion Analysis
```python
from boxmot.utils.occlusion_handler import OcclusionAwareTracker, OverlapAnalyzer

# Initialize occlusion analyzer
overlap_analyzer = OverlapAnalyzer(overlap_threshold=0.3)

# Analyze overlaps in detections
boxes = np.array([[x1, y1, x2, y2], ...])  # Detection boxes
overlap_matrix = overlap_analyzer.compute_overlap_matrix(boxes)
spatial_info = overlap_analyzer.analyze_spatial_relationships(boxes)

# Detect crowd situations
from boxmot.utils.occlusion_handler import detect_crowd_situations
is_crowd = detect_crowd_situations(tracks, density_threshold=0.3)
```

### Real-time Occlusion Monitoring
```python
# Track with occlusion monitoring
for frame_id, (img, detections) in enumerate(video_stream):
    tracks = tracker.update(detections, img)
    
    # Monitor occlusion events
    stats = tracker.get_track_statistics()
    if stats.get('occluded_tracks', 0) > 0:
        print(f"Frame {frame_id}: {stats['occluded_tracks']} tracks occluded")
    
    # Check for crowd situations
    if stats.get('crowd_mode', False):
        print(f"Frame {frame_id}: Crowd mode activated")
    
    # Get detailed occlusion info for each track
    for track in tracker.tracker.tracks:
        if hasattr(tracker, 'occlusion_tracker'):
            occlusion_level = tracker.occlusion_tracker.occlusion_manager.get_occlusion_level(track.id)
            if occlusion_level > 0.1:
                print(f"Track {track.id}: {occlusion_level:.1%} occluded")
```

## üîç Detailed Feature Descriptions

### 1. Multi-Stage Matching Cascade

The enhanced matching process operates in multiple stages:

1. **High-Confidence Stage**: Priority matching for high-confidence detections with confirmed tracks
2. **Medium-Confidence Stage**: Standard matching for medium-confidence detections
3. **IoU-Based Stage**: Motion-based matching for remaining tracks and detections
4. **ID Recovery Stage**: Attempt to recover lost IDs using appearance similarity

### 2. Quality Scoring System

Each track and detection receives a comprehensive quality score based on:

- **Detection confidence**
- **Feature quality** (magnitude and distinctiveness)
- **Bounding box quality** (aspect ratio and size)
